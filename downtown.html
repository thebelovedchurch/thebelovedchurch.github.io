              <ul>
                <li>We have accepted Jesus Christ as personal Lord  and Savior (John 1:12).</li>
                <li>We believe that the Bible, though written by  man, was inspired by God (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20-21) and thus is God's  perfect revelation (2 Sam. 22:31; Ps. 12:6) of the truth that underlies our  faith (Acts 17:11: Mark 12:24).</li>
                <li>We believe in one God, master and creator of the  universe (I Cor. 8:5-6), who reveals Himself as three distinct persons, Father,  Son, and Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19; John 14:26, Eph. 3:14-17).</li>
                <li>We believe that Jesus was fully human and fully  divine (Phil. 2:6-8; Col. 1:15, 2:9) and lived a sinless life (2 Cor. 5:21;  Heb. 4:15), perfectly revealing God (John 1:14; Heb. 1:3).</li>
                <li>We believe that all men and women are separated  from God by their sin (Rom. 3:10, 23) but can be reconciled to God through  Jesus' death on the cross, the perfect and only acceptable sacrifice for  people's sins (1 Peter 3:18; Heb. 10:14; 1 Tim. 2:5-6).</li>
                <li>We believe that people must put their trust in  Jesus Christ alone (Eph. 2:8-9; John 14:6; John 3:16) as their personal Lord  and Savior in order to receive eternal life, which includes an eternal home in  Heaven (John 14:1-6; Rev. 7:9, 21:1-5); those who die in their sin without  Christ face an eternity of punishment in hell (Matt. 23:15, 33; Rev. 20:15).</li>
                <li>We believe in the Holy Spirit of God that  indwells believers upon conversion (Rom. 8:9, 15-16; John 14:16-17) to gift,  guide, and empower us for obedience and service.</li>

              <p>To be a community that understands the  statement, "Cheer up we are far worse than we think we are." And the  second statement, "Cheer up we are far more accepted than we could hope or  imagine." (Jack Miller: Sonship)</p>
              <p>To be a community of grace, where we live out  the sentence from Luke 15:2, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with  them."</p>
              <p>To have a passion for souls that have not yet  had the privilege of knowing they are the beloved of God because of Christ  alone.</p>

              <p><strong>The Gospel</strong>:          The  'gospel' is the good news that through Christ the power of God's kingdom has  entered history to renew the whole world. When we believe and rely on Jesus'  work and record (rather than ours) for our relationship to God, that kingdom  power comes upon us and begins to work through us.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                The Gospel changes people from the inside out.  Christ gives us a radically new identity, freeing us from both  self-righteousness and self-condemnation. He liberates us to accept people we  once excluded, and to break the bondage of things (even good things) that once  drove us. The gospel makes us welcoming and respectful toward those who are  different from us.&nbsp; 
              </p>
              <p> The Gospel is for both believers and unbelievers.  It is also both personal and collective in its scope.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><strong>Church of  the Beloved believes in five foundational pillars of the biblical church:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Worship &amp; Prayer:</strong> Our church is committed to genuine, biblical  worship in the freedom of the Gospel. &nbsp;Songs of praise &amp; worship, time  for prayer, expository preaching of God’s Word, and the administration of the  Sacraments are foundational to the celebration of corporate worship we  experience. &nbsp;We believe that prayer is a primary means of grace through  which we express our dependence on God for everything. </p>
              <p><strong>Fellowship &amp; Community: &nbsp;</strong>Our church seeks to  do life together the way the early church modeled community. &nbsp;We seek to  be intentional about sharing our lives with each other through encouragement,  generosity, speaking the word to one another, serving one another, confessing  sins to one another, praying, and building each other up toward Christ. &nbsp;We  will do this through small groups that will meet regularly. &nbsp;Fellowship  comes from a shared identity as children of God, a shared service and mission,  and a shared responsibility to one another. (adapted from John Stott.)</p>
              <p><strong>Learning &amp; Discipleship: </strong>Our church is committed to making disciples  of Jesus and sending out leaders into the world. &nbsp;We will be intentional  as staff and leaders to investing time in discipling our members to become  disciple makers.</p>
              <p><strong>Missions &amp; Evangelism: </strong>Our church will actively seek to proclaim and  practice the Gospel both in our local community and abroad. &nbsp;We will do  this through intercessory prayer, radical generosity, Christ exalting worship,  building relationships with people who are outside the church, training and  equipping our members to have a passion for the lost both here and in the  nations.</p>
              <p><strong>Mercy &amp; Social Concern: </strong>Our church is committed to being a light to  the community around us. We want to impact the neighborhoods around us by  identifying felt needs in the community, and seeking to partner with existing  ministries to most effectively meet the needs of the community in sustainable  ways.</p>

Since having received God's immense grace in high school, Hanqi has worked towards growing together in understanding and living out that reality.During his time at Moody, he cultivated a burgeoning desire to minister to people in Europe having spent some time traveling in Europe, and hopes one day to minister there.
